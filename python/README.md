1. [Bagels](./Bagels/) 
    - In Bagels, a deductive logic game, you must guess a secret three-digit number based on clues.
    - Bagels is a simple game to program but can be difficult to win at. But if you keep playing, you’ll eventually discover better ways to guess and make use of the clues the game gives you. This is much like how you’ll get better at programming the you more you keep at it.
